# WebGameStub

WebGameStub helps you get a quick and easy start on writing an HTML5 game with 2D canvas with a simple template and a few tools.
WebGameStub offers a good starting point for the game itself and smoothes off a variety of the rough edges associated with writing and publishing a Web app.

WebGameStub is about saving you time and effort so that you can focus on writing your game.
It's about not having to write the most basic game infrastructure pieces, like canvas setup and an update/render loop.
It's about having an easier starting point than a blank canvas.
It's about not having to spend your time stitching together the usual cross-browser bits associated with bootstrapping an app on the web.

## Getting started

* Download the current version of this project from
[the downloads page](https://github.com/mozilla/WebGameStub/downloads)
* Open the index.html file in the www folder in a web browser
* Edit the application in www/js/app.js and then reload the index.html file to see how your changes affect the game

#Extra Features (requires node.js)

# Prerequisites for extras

* be sure [node.js and npm](http://nodejs.org/) are installed and in your PATH
* (optional) if you wish to deploy to github pages, ensure that
 [git](http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect) is installed and configured
* Use npm to install volo into your path, if it's not there already:

    > npm install -g volo

## Simple library installation

Add any libraries that you intend to use.  volo uses github's search API to
find them and grabs the latest released version.

    > volo add three.js
    Using github repo "mrdoob/three.js" for "three.js"...
    Downloading: https://raw.github.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/build/Three.js
    Installed github:mrdoob/three.js/master at js/three.js

    > volo add stats.js
    Using github repo "mrdoob/stats.js" for "stats.js"...
    Downloading: https://raw.github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/master/build/Stats.js
    Installed github:mrdoob/stats.js/master at www/js/lib/stats.js

## Optimize for high performance

Build a minified version complete with an appcache file:

    > volo appcache
    (...)

## Deploy to github pages

Deploy the built version to the gh-pages branch of suitably named repo:

    > volo ghdeploy
    Log in to GitHub to complete action (your password is not saved. It is sent over SSL to GitHub and converted to an OAuth token)
    GitHub user name: dmose
    GitHub password:
    Contacting GitHub...
      (...)
    To git@github.com:dmose/monkeyGame.git
    e5dbfd4..1296c81  gh-pages -> gh-pages
    GitHub Pages is set up. Check http://dmose.github.com/monkeyGame/ in about 10-15 minutes.
