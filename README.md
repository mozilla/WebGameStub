# WebGameStub
<I think we can pull heavily from the blog post for this part. At the very least, we should use similar language and cover the same details.>
WebGameStub helps you get a quick and easy start on writing an HTML5 game with 2D canvas with a simple template and a few tools.
WebGameStub  offers a good starting point for the game itself and smoothes off a  variety of the rough edges associated with writing and publishing a Web game.

WebGameStub is about saving you time and effort so that you can focus on writing your game.
It's about not having to write the most basic game infrastructure pieces, like canvas setup and an update/render loop.
It's about having an easier starting point than a blank canvas.
It's  about not having to spend your time stitching together the usual  cross-browser bits associated with bootstrapping an app on the web.
And once you've got a game you're proud of, it's about making it easy to publish into the app stores on the web, including the new Mozilla Marketplace.

## Getting started
* Download the current version of this project from
[the downloads page](https://github.com/mozilla/WebGameStub/downloads)
* Open the index.html file in the www folder in a web browser
* Edit the application in www/js/app.js and then reload the index.html file to see how your changes affect the game
* (deploy) <Where do they deploy it to? Is this synonymous with publishing the game?>
* <INSERT TUTORIAL LINK HERE>
<I think we need more details here, especially in the last few points. Can probably omit the part about editing the JSON files, since that's not really required for getting started. We can also link out to the tutorial.>
#Extra Features (requires node.js)
<Start by explaining what the extra features are. Then elaborate on how to use them and what the prerequisites are.> <Don't really have the knowledge needed to write this section>
### Install node.js first
* Go to [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
* Download and install whatever package is appropriate for your platform
## Optimize for high performance
volo build+minify
## Deploy to github pages
volo ghdeploy
## Simple library installation
volo add
<The instructions for using the extra features needs more detail, and probably some concrete examples.> <Yeah, I know. I don't know how to use these tools, so the descriptions here could probably be done much more quickly by someone else>
## Publishing your game
Once your game is finished, you can publish it to a number of web marketplaces in order to reach your audience.
### Mozilla Marketplace
To publish your game to the Mozilla Marketplace:
1. Edit the application manifest template `www/game.webapp` in your project directory and fill in the required fields. Additional documentation for the mainfest file format is available [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Apps/Manifest). Note that you are free to rename `game.webapp` to something else.

2. Check that your manifest is correct using the [App Manifest tool](http://appmanifest.org/).

3. Visit the [Mozilla Marketplace](https://marketplace.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/) and follow the instructions for submitting your application.

### Chrome Web Store
To publish your game to the [Chrome Web Store]():
1. Edit the application manifest template `www/manifest.json` in your project directory and fill in the require fields. Additional documentation for the manifest file format is available [here](https://developers.google.com/chrome/apps/docs/developers_guide#manifest).
2. Follow the instructions in the [developer tutorial](https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/docs/get_started_simple).
